# Transfer learning task
 This project is about learning three new classes through transfer learning.

 - Summary
     - There are weights for about five classes that have already been trained.
     - Use these weights for transfer learning with three classes.
     - Create an ONNX file.
     - Quantize that model to INT8.

 - How to execute
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python transfer_learning.py
   ```
